              <p>MobileNets are small, low-latency, low-power models
                  that can solve a variety of use cases. The are commonly used
                  for classification and detection use cases, as well as for generating
                  feature embeddings for different types of data.</p>

              <p>For this reason, MobileNet is great for image classification, and can be retrained for your own use case via transfer learning if the out-of-the-box classifications don't suit your needs. It is trained on the
                  <a href="https://image-net.org/"> ImageNet</a> image database.</p>

                <p>COCO-SSD is an object detection model available as part of the default model 
                    set for TensorFlow.js. SSD, or Single Shot MultiBox Detection, is a type of model 
                    that can identify multiple objects in an image.</p>

                <p>COCO-SSD is able to detect 80 different classes of objects based on the 
                    <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home"> Common Objects in Context, or COCO</a>, dataset.</p>
